1. What is a natural join in SQL?

A NATURAL JOIN is a JOIN operation that creates an implicit join
clause for you based on the common columns in the two tables being joined.
Common columns are columns that have the same name in both tables.
A NATURAL JOIN can be an INNER join, a LEFT OUTER join, or a RIGHT OUTER join.
The default is INNER join.

2. The SQL CASE Expression

The CASE expresison goes through conditions and returns a value when
the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement).
So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result.
If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL
CASE WHEN > THEN , WHEN > THEN, ELSE, END

3. Join = Inner Join by default

4. Aggregate functions, such as max() are applied to each group as determined
by the group by clause.
-select max(num) from number group by num having count(*)=1 X
-select max(num) from
                (select num
                from number
                group by num
                having count(*) = 1) t  OK

5. Window function
- lead() get the next data
- lag() get the previous data

6. Create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>" and "15 minutes or more"
- Select "[0-5>" as bins
  UNION ALL
  Select "[5-10>" as bins
  UNION ALL
  Select "[10-15>" as bins
  UNION ALL
  Select "15 minutes or more" as bins

7. COUNT(*) and COUNT(1) are identical

8. The difference between Union and Union All is that Union All will not
removes duplicate rows or records

9. Self Join
      1 a
      2 b
      3 c
      becomes
      1 a 1 a
      1 a 2 b
      1 a 3 c
      2 b 1 a
      2 b 2 b
      2 b 3 c
      3 c 1 a
      3 c 2 b
      3 c 3 c

10. to get the null data >> WHERE B.Bonus is NULL

11. USING clause : Use "USING" clause instead of "ON" clause

Join = Inner Join (I think)
The following query performs an inner join between the COUNTRIES table and
the CITIES table on the condition that COUNTRIES.COUNTRY is equal to CITIES.COUNTRY:
-- you need a bracket after USING clause

      SELECT *
      FROM COUNTRIES
      JOIN CITIES
      USING (COUNTRY)


12. Where content == "Y" WRONGGG only one equal sign needed!
    Where content = "Y" OK

13. GROUP_CONCAT

MySQL GROUP_CONCAT() function returns a string with concatenated non-NULL value from a group.
    -- +------------+-------------+
    -- | sell_date  | product     |
    -- +------------+-------------+
    -- | 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
    -- | 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
    -- | 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |
    -- +------------+-------------+

    becomes

    -- Result table:
    -- +------------+----------+------------------------------+
    -- | sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
    -- +------------+----------+------------------------------+
    -- | 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
    -- +------------+----------+------------------------------+

14. where description != "boring"
    same as
    where description not in ("boring")
