-- Question 15
-- Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

-- +----+--------+
-- | Id | Salary |
-- +----+--------+
-- | 1  | 100    |
-- | 2  | 200    |
-- | 3  | 300    |
-- +----+--------+
-- For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary.
-- If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

-- +---------------------+
-- | SecondHighestSalary |
-- +---------------------+
-- | 200                 |
-- +---------------------+

-- Solution

select a.salary
from
(select salary,
rank() over(order by salary)
from Employee)a
where a.rk = 2

select max(salary)
from Employee
where salary != (select max(salary) from Employee)
